# Specification Quality Checklist: Break Timer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-07-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed on first validation iteration
- The spec references `break_minutes` by name as it is a user-facing setting label, not an implementation detail
- FR-012 constrains scope ("no backend changes") based on the feature description — this is a scope boundary, not an implementation detail
- 3 user stories cover: automatic transition (P1), break completion (P1), and skip break (P2)
- 4 edge cases identified: min/max break duration, settings change mid-break, app close during break
